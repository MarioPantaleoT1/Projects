1/28: Set up basis, idk how to malloc 2d arrays
1/30: figured it out, got everything working and set, inefficiently. Lots of uneeded code probably.
1/30: à¶ž is considered a multi-character character constant and cannot be printed :pensive:

2/2: I am not sure how structs work, but I tried to add some.
2/3: Sheaffer helped me define the structs and I refactored all of my code to match.
2/3: Fixed how checks work to make them pointers so that each map saved values.
2/5: Made functions to actually run the code and remembered I needed to malloc them, got each of the directions working.
2/6: Fixed flying and printing out the correct map if you move to the same place or outside the map.
2/6: Made it so paths connect correctly.
2/7: Added a loop that frees the memory before the program exits.

2/11: Started on heap
2/12: Got heap working 
2/13: Problem with dijkstras
2/14: Got it entirely working
2/19: Got it to print out nicely

2/20: Implemented methods for hiker and rival to move them to the player, both work.
2/20: Added swimmers as well
2/26: Got everyone other than player moving without a que, will add que later
2/27: Implemented character que and everything works, character moves as well

3/1: Started working on curses
3/3: Got the basics set up
3/7: Got the char map working, i can change maps, but it is duplicating the characters
3/17: Fixed character duplication, now its having a problem with chain changing maps
3/20: Fixed map changing problem
3/21: I can't read and didnt see that moving maps with the character wasnt reqired, but it works anyways
3/21: Also didn't read that we were doing trainer dialogue, so I added that as well

3/24: Already finished movement across maps on the last assignment, so I converted it to c++ and fixed mallocs and switch case
3/27: Added fly
3/28: Converted structs to classes
3/29: Fixed weird bug with moving maps on gates

4/2: Set up all the classes to hold the information parsed
4/3: Finished the extremely tedious parsing of all the files into an object
4/4: Added all the print statements for inputs
4/5: Made it so the home directory also works

4/9: Set up the pokemon objects and made the pokemon generation function
4/10: Fixed pokemon generation function with correct distances, apparently getch() implicitly calls refresh which took an hour to find out
4/11: Narrowed down most random crashes being due to pokemon generation
4/11: Pretty sure I fixed them by only seeding rand once instead of per method

4/16: Set up opening bag and viewing pokemon in wild and frame for battles
4/17: Fleshed out battles, should be nearly fully working, catch rate is currently 100%
4/17: Made pokemon have a chance of up to 4 moves because easier to guarantee a damaging move
4/17: I believe I fixed starting crash problem, was due to some pokemon never learning a first or second move
4/18: Small touch ups to bugs here and there 
4/19: Fixed crit to be the correct equation and made sure items > 0 to use

4/20: Added type chart
4/22: Fully implemented type effectivenesses and made a function that allows player to switch ordering of pokemon in bag
4/24: Started working on a box for extra pokemon accesible anywhere through bag
4/25: Implemented proper catch rates and started trying to get exp working with dumb pokemon_evolutions csv
4/26: Got evolutions and xp working, box works mostly but is ugly becuase windows are dumb
4/27: Made it so trainers drop money and xp gained is printed out
4/28: Made pokemarts that actually sell and buy things
4/30: Made pokemarts work correctly
4/30: Made it so pokemon learn moves on level up, not printing correctly
5/1: Pokemon learn moves correctly, drawn from all generations, so it will learn each move at its earliest point in each gen
